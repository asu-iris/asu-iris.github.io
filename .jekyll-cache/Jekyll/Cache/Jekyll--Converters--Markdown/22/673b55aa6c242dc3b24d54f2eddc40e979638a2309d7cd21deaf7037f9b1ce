I"†<p>Welcome to the <strong>Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS)</strong> Lab! Our research is centered around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Human robot alignment:</strong>  We develop methods to empower a robot with the ability to efficiently understand and be understood by human users through a variety of physical interactions. We explore how robots can aptly respond to and collaborate meaningfully with users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contact-rich robot manipulation:</strong> We leverage physical principles to derive representations/models that enable robots to interact efficiently with their surroundings. We  develop algorithms to enable robots manipulate objects through contact efficiently and robustly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fundamental methods in robotics:</strong> We focus on developing fundamental theories and algorithms for achieving efficient, safe, and robust robot intelligence. Our methods lie at the intersection of model-based (control and optimization) and data-driven approaches, harnessing the complementary benefits of both.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
