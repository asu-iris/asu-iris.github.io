I"Ì<p>Welcome to the  <strong>ASU Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS)</strong> Lab! Our lab is focused on developing <strong>interactive intelligence</strong>, which makes robots to</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>seamlessly interact with individual users</strong>, by understanding human intent, assisting with human decision-making, achieving  personalized intelligence through  interaction with each human user, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>dexterously manipulating objects</strong>, by finding effective physical representations for efficient control and planning, touching and affecting objects in a safe and skillful way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our solutions to interactive intelligence combines  theoretical understanding of  fundamentals with empirical learning from readily accessible data.  Our approaches are positioned at the intersection of control, optimization (model-based) and machine learning (data-driven), leveraging the complementary benefits of both.</p>
