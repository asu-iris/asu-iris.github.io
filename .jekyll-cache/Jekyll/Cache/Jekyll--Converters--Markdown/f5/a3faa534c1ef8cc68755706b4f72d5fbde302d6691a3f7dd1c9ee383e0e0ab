<p style="margin-bottom:0.6cm"> </p>

<p>The Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS) lab at Arizona State University (ASU) is seeking <strong>two Ph.D. applicants</strong> in the areas of robot learning and control for human-robot interaction and robot dexterous manipulation. The positions will commence as early as Spring 2024 and are fully funded (tuition + monthly salary).</p>

<p>The IRIS lab focuses on developing interactive intelligence, enabling robots to (1) seamlessly interact with humans by understanding human intent, assisting with human decision-making, improving their intelligence through human intuitive interactions, and (2) skillfully manipulate physical objects by learning and planning with physical representations, touching and affecting objects with maximum dexterity, toward human-level physical intelligence.</p>
