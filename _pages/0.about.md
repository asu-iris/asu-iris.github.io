Welcome to the **Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS)** Lab! Our research is centered around:

- **Human robot alignment:**  We develop methods to empower a robot with the ability to efficiently understand and be understood by human users through a variety of physical interactions. We explore how robots can aptly respond to and collaborate meaningfully with users.

- **Contact-rich robot manipulation:** We leverage physical principles to derive representations/models that enable robots to interact efficiently with their surroundings. We  develop algorithms to enable robots manipulate objects through contact efficiently and robustly.

- **Fundamental methods in robotics:** We focus on developing fundamental theories and algorithms for achieving efficient, safe, and robust robot intelligence. Our methods lie at the intersection of model-based (control and optimization) and data-driven approaches, harnessing the complementary benefits of both.
