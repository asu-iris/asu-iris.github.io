Welcome to the  **ASU Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS)** Lab! Our lab is focused on developing <strong>interactive intelligence</strong>, which makes robots to
- **seamlessly interact with humans**, by understanding human intent, assisting with human decision-making, improving
its intelligence through human intuitive interactions, toward safe and personalized human-robot relationship; 

- **skillfully manipulating physical objects**, by learning and planning with physical representations, 
touching and affecting objects with maximum dexterity while ensuring safety and controllability, toward human-level physical intelligence.

We develop our solutions for interactive intelligence by combining a theoretical understanding of system fundamentals with empirical learning from readily accessible data. Our approaches are positioned at the intersection of control/optimization (model-based) and machine learning (data-driven), leveraging the complementary benefits of both.
