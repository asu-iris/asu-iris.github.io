This is **Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS)** Lab! Our research focuses include

- **Human-robot alignment:**  We develop innovative methods that enable robots to seamlessly understand and communicate with humans through various physical interactions. Our work includes developing adaptive learning algorithms and intuitive control interfaces to enhance  representation alignment between humans and robots.

- **Contact-rich manipulation:** We develop advanced physics-based representations and frameworks that enable robots to interact with and manipulate physical objects efficiently and precisely. Our goal is to enhance robotsâ€™ capabilities in performing complex tasks, such as assembly and sorting, in unstructured environments.

- **Fundamental methods for robot autonomy:** We develop fundamental theories/algorithms for  efficient, safe, and robust robot intelligence, by harnessing the complementary benefits of model-based (control/optimization) and data-driven (machine learning & AI) approaches.

    Robots may be good at inferring a task reward from human feedbak, but how about inferring safety boundaries from human feedback? In many cases such as robot feeding and liquid pouring, specifying  user-comfortable safety constraints is more challenging  than  rewards. Our recent work, led by  our PhD student <a href="https://zhi-xian-xie.github.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Zhixian Xie</strong></a>,  shows that this can be possile and acutally very human-effort efficient! Our method is called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04216" target="_blank"><strong>Safe MPC Alignment</strong></a> (submitted to T-RO), enabling a robot to learn its control safety constraints with only a small handful of human online corrections!
    <br>
    <br> 
    Importantly, the Safe MPC Alignment is certifiable: providing an upper bound on the total number of human feedback in the case of successful learning of safety constraints, or declaring the misspecification of the hypothesis space, i.e., the true implicit safety constraint cannot be found within the specified hypothesis space.
