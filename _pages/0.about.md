Welcome to the  **IRIS** Lab! We focus on developing <strong>interactive intelligence</strong>, which enables autonomous systems to

- **seamlessly interact with individual users**, by understanding user intent, assisting with user decision-making, achieving  personalized intelligence through  interaction with  each user, and 

- **dexterously manipulating objects**, by finding effective physical representations for efficient control and planning, touching and affecting objects in a safe and controlled way.

Our solutions to interactive intelligence combines  theoretical understanding of  fundamentals with empirical learning from readily accessible data.  Our approaches are positioned at the intersection of model-based (control and optimization) and data-driven methods, leveraging the complementary benefits of both.
