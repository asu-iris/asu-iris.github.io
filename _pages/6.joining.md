#### **Two Ph.D. Positions Available!**

<p style="margin-bottom:0.6cm"> </p>

The Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS) lab at Arizona State University (ASU) is seeking **two Ph.D. applicants** in the areas of robot learning and control for human-robot interaction and robot dexterous manipulation. The positions will commence as early as Spring 2024 and are fully funded (tuition + monthly salary).


The IRIS lab focuses on developing interactive intelligence, enabling robots to (1) seamlessly interact with humans by understanding human intent, assisting with human decision-making, improving their intelligence through human intuitive interactions, and (2) skillfully manipulate physical objects by learning and planning with physical representations, touching and affecting objects with maximum dexterity, toward human-level physical intelligence. 


##### **Research Topics**
- Robot learning with human general interactions (e.g., physical interaction and/or language interaction)
- Planning and control for human-robot systems
- Computer vision and learnable geometry for dexterous manipulation
- Task and motion planning for sequential manipulation
- Fundamental research  in planning, control, and machine learning.

##### **Basic Requirement**
- Strong passion for the above research areas and desire to solve challenging problems
- Master's degree in robotics, mechanical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, or a related field with outstanding academic performance
- Strong analytical and coding skills
- Good communication skills in both written and spoken English, meeting the English requirement from the School: [https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/mechanical-graduate/](https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/mechanical-graduate/){:target="_blank"}

<p style="margin-bottom:0.6cm"> </p>

##### **Desired Skills**
- Knowledge of robotics, controls, planning, and machine learning
- Knowledge of optimization and linear algebra
- Experience in machine learning or computer vision, proficient in learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch)
- Experience in robot programming, especially with Python and C++
